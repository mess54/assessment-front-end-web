		<h1>About</h1>

		<p>
		My name is Jessica Alex Menna. I am lucky enough to have a dog, a cat, and a mom and
		dad and four brothers that I am close with. I like to spend my free time watching anime
		and playing video games such as World of Warcraft. A fun fact about me is that I have
		written 20,000 words of a novel that I'll never finish. It was fun while it lasted though. 
		I have been supporting myself since I was 16 years old and my independence is very important
		to me. I have learned that strict independence is actually a trauma response. Lol. So I am
		trying to learn that it's okay to not be okay and lean on those that are the closest to you. 
		Life for me hasn't really ever been easy but I am doing my best. I am your typical comic with
		major depressive disorder that loves nothing more than to make people laugh. They say that 
		laughter is the best medicine and I totally agree with that. If you need to ever get cheered up 
		just let me know and I'll crack a joke for you and make you smile.
