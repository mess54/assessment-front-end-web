<h1>About Me</h1>

<h2>Career Goals</h2>
<p>My career aspirations include getting myself out of shitty call center sales jobs and into a 
    position that I actually enjoy. I have been wanting to break into the tech industry for years
    and finally found myself in a position financially to take some time off of work and go
    to school at DevMoutain. I hope to land a job as an iOS developer in the future after I graduate.
